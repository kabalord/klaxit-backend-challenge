# Klaxit backend challenge

Looking for a job? Check out our [open positions](https://klaxit.workable.com).

If you want to join Klaxit backend team, here is the best way to prove your skills !

## Quick intro

You are building a carpooling service where...
* Any user can be a driver or a passenger,
* A ride includes a driver and a passenger,
* The passenger "cost" is transferred to the driver as a "profit",
* Sponsorships can be applied to reduce passenger cost.

Completing the 3 levels, you will implement these mechanisms.

## Guidelines

For each level, write code that creates a new `level*/output.json` file from the `input.json` file. A `level*/expected_output.json` file is available to give you a reference on which output is expected at each level.

- Clone this repo,
- Solve the levels in ascending order,
- Don't hesitate to write shameless code at first and refactor it afterward,
- Keep only one commit per level ([git autosquash](https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/git-commit-fixup-autosquash) can help you).

## Send us your achievement

Zip the whole project, including `.git` and send it to us (by email if you are already in contact with us or by uploading it while applying to an [open position](https://klaxit.workable.com)).
